Python - Network #0

Tasks 6 
The function first checks for edge cases (list of length 0, 1, or 2) and returns the appropriate result. For a list of length greater than 2, it uses a binary search algorithm to find a peak element. The algorithm starts by checking the middle element of the list. If the middle element is a peak, the algorithm returns it. Otherwise, it compares the middle element with its neighbors. If the middle element is smaller than its left neighbor, then the peak must be in the left half of the list. Otherwise, the peak must be in the right half of the list. The algorithm then repeats this process on the appropriate half of the list until it finds a peak element.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n)). This is because at each step of the algorithm, we divide the remaining list into two halves, and we only consider one half in the next step. Therefore, the number of steps required to find a peak is proportional to log(n).
